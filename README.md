### Let's make a line chart!!!

* Build a line chart using [this bl.ocks example](http://bl.ocks.org/mbostock/3883245) as a starting point. 
* Start by cloning this repository.
* The data is in the Excel file. You'll need to format it to tsv, csv or json. It's up to you. 
* Scales hint: You'll need to [parse the dates](https://github.com/mbostock/d3/wiki/Time-Formatting) differently than in the example.
* Write a headline and dek that relate to what you see in the data.
* The source line should link to the [St. Louis Federal Reserve](https://research.stlouisfed.org/fred2/).
